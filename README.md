| Description     | You must create a basic 2D game in which a dolphin    |
|                 | escapes Earth after eating some fish. Instead of     |
|                 | a dolphin, fish, and the Earth, you can use any      |
|                 | character, any collectible, and any place you want.  |

I finally used [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42), and my game wasn't about a dolphin eating fish. I designed everything myself (the quality isn't great), but I decided 
to dedicate most of the time to code and actually making the game work, instead of having a high quality game that works badly/has memory leaks/crashes.
